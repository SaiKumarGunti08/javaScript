API - Application Program Interface

fetch()- The fetch method is used to handle api's.the fetch concept is very newly introduced around 4-5yrs ago.

Before the fetch method, another method is used to handle APIs called XML HTTP requests.

XMLHttpRequest is heavily used in AJAX programming.

Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (Ajax, or AJAX) is a web development technique in which a web app fetches content from the server by making asynchronous HTTP requests, and uses the new content to update the relevant parts of the page without requiring a full page load. This can make the page more responsive, because only the parts that need to be updated are requested.

Ajax can be used to create single-page apps, in which the entire web app consists of a single document, which uses Ajax to update its content as needed.
